# Shopify Frontend Developer Intern Challenge

This my (Vishnu Satish) submission for the Shopify Frontend Developer Intern Challenge 2022.

This application is called "Space 4 Everyone" and fetches data from the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day API and displays the media. 

Users can like and copy a shareable link to the media. Users can also reload the media, which will fetch a given number of random pieces of media from the NASA API.

This application follows Shopify's guidelines for accessibility, best practices, and content guidelines.
